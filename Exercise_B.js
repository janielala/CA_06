/*  ====================== */
/** Write a function that expects a number as a parameter. 
 * If the number that is entered is less than 0, equal to 0, or not a number, 
 * the function should return the string ‘ERROR’. If the number that is entered 
 * is greater than or equal to 1000000 it should simply return the number. 
 * Otherwise it should multiply the number by 10 however many times it takes 
 * to get a number that is greater than or equal to 1000000 and return that number. 
 * Consider which loop you will need to use to do this.
Use a combination of conditionals and loops to create your answer for this question. */
